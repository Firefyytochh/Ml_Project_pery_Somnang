        "#Dataset\n",
        "The dataset used in this project consists of weather forecast records from 2018 to 2025, focusing on key meteorological indicators relevant to rainfall prediction. The data was compiled from historical forecasts and archived records during this period, ensuring a consistent and continuous timeline of weather trends. This approach enabled the capture of seasonal patterns, annual variations, and temporal dependencies necessary for accurate rain prediction without relying on real-time online sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Methodology\n",
        "Collected data was cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing features, and structuring the dataset to suit machine learning requirements. To robustly evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting, the dataset was split into training, validation, and test subsets. This allowed effective model training, tuning, and unbiased final assessment.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Model Selection\n",
        "Several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated for the rain detection task. Logistic Regression served as a simple baseline model offering interpretability and a performance benchmark. Random Forest was employed to capture nonlinear relationships and reduce overfitting through ensemble methods. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was tested for its strong classification capabilities, especially on small to medium-sized datasets. Additionally, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks were utilized to capture temporal dependencies inherent in time-series weather data, aiming to improve predictive accuracy by leveraging sequential patterns. Each model was trained and compared under consistent conditions to identify the most suitable approach for rainfall prediction."
