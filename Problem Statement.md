-Heavy rainfall and sudden storms are frequent in Cambodia, often causing floods, transportation disruptions, and damage to agriculture and infrastructure.

-There is currently a lack of accessible, real-time rain detection and alert systems to provide early warnings, especially for rural communities and vulnerable areas.

-This project aims to develop a fast, accurate, and accessible rain detection system to help citizens, farmers, and authorities respond proactively, reducing the risks of flood-related damage, improving transportation safety, and supporting disaster preparedness.
