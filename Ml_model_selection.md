Implemented Logistic Regression as a simple baseline model for rain detection classification.

Applied Random Forest due to its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and reduce overfitting through ensemble learning.

Tested Support Vector Machine (SVM) for its effectiveness in classification with small to medium datasets.

Utilized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to capture temporal dependencies in time-series weather data."
