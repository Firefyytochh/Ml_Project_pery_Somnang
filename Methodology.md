"Collected weather data from OpenWeatherMap API, NASA GPM, and Kaggle datasets to ensure a wide range of historical and real-time weather information.

Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and structuring it for machine learning use.

Split the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance effectively and prevent overfitting."
